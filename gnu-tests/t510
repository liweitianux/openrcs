# Check that ‘ci -i’ works, with varying other options.
# Specifically, the command should:
# - write nothing to stdout
# - write something (unspecified) to stderr
# - create the RCS file
#   - read-only, non-empty
#   - with revision ‘1.1’ in both the tree and log
#   - with the internally generated log message "Initial revision"
# - remove the working file
